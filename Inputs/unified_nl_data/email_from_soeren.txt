Hi Yasu,

the 5 models are:
IHEP 1, LBNL, BCW 1+6, IHEP marginal 3.

I attach all 5 models:

IHEP : Model1.root, positronFull is the nominal curve, positronFullMarg3 is marginal 3.
If you need the full marginal 3 with gamma and electron NL, it's in flt_glb_marg3.root

BCW1+6: eff_model1.root/eff_model6.root

Hi Yasu,

This is the model Xin summarized.

Hi Soeren,

Could you send me the list of the final set of 5/8 non-linearity curves?
I can see some curves in doc-8995 and doc-8992, but I'm confused which curves are in the final model.

Thanks,

Yasu
